1. Using prisma as an ORM for JavaScript sitting between app and database
2. Using the command 'npx prisma init --datasource-provider sqlite' to specify db to use (could be any database)
3. Migrating database using 'npx prisma migrate dev'. Looks a lot like python manage.py makemigrations/migrate
4. Creating a PrismaClient to make db queries using NextJS using PrismaClient from @prisma/client
